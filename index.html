<h3>What is your favorite thing about providing technical support?</h3>
<p>The thing I love most with providing technical support is helping the customer come up with a solution to their problem. I love problem solving in general and usually when a customer calls in they are more than likely
  annoyed so we can both come to a positive resolution at the end it makes me feel good at the end</p>

<h3>What did you think of our service during the time you used it?  Be honest!  “it sucked” isn’t a wrong answer unless you don’t elaborate and provide some constructive criticism ;)</h3>

<p>I found the service to be extremely straight forward and very easy for me to use since I use github quite often. I think
  any developer would be able to follow along rather easily so that's a bonus but on the flip side perhaps it may not be detailed
  enough for your average person. I guess it all depends on who the target audience is.</p>

  <h3>Tell about how you made your site and why you chose the tools you did.  Briefly explain a challenge you experienced in setting up this site and how you solved it.</h3>
  I used StaticGen's one drop deploy to Netlify using the MetalSmith site generator. There was really no reasoning for using this particular one
  outside of it used handlebars as the templating which I have used previously. From there I cloned the repository to my local machine and made sure it was connected to glyphicon-thumbs-up
  so I could push changes.
  <h3>Could you give us a suggestion to improve this test or the job posting?</h3>

  <p>One suggestion I have is using a few real world examples on what a ticket might look like and have the candidate
  write out the answer like he was actually talking to a Netlify customer.</p>

<h3>Provide a link to documentation for a technical/developer-focused product, that you think are well done, and briefly explain why you think they are well done.</h3>

<a href="	https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-wordpress-one-click-install">Digital Ocean</a>

<p>I chose digital ocean for my documentation because I have used their service pretty frequently 	for hosting my websites. The link above was actually something I used personally when setting 	up my wordpress site. What I enjoy about Digital Ocean’s documentation is their frequent use 	of images when reading their docs. For me personally and I think a lot of people they will do 	better if they see images over a wall of text. With Digital Ocean it is usually a paragraph or two 	and then an image so it doesn’t feel too intimidating. Another thing I enjoy about them is that 	they don’t presume you know everything there is to know about the topic at hand. They write it
	so even your average non-technical user can follow along.</p>

  <h3>Why do you think SSL/HTTPS is important?</h3>
  <p>	It’s important because you are going to want your client’s data to be secure when they visit your 	website and start putting in personal details. No one wants to deal with websites if your personal
	details are not in good hands.</p>

  <h3>Explain, in a couple of paragraphs, what you think 2 major challenges around DNS configuration are for less-technical internet end-users</h3>

  <p>	The first major challenge in my opinion for DNS configuration has to do with configuring your 	domain name. For people that have never set up a host name they would see the list of records 	such as A, AAAA, CNAME, etc. and right then and there they would not know how to proceed 	because they do not know which ones to fill out or if you should all out of them. An example 	would be if you wanted to use both www and a non-www domain, then you would need to add 	both those records. One to A type and the other to CNAME.<p>

  <p></p>
  <p></p>

  <p>	The second challenge is when they finally do put in a host name in the correct record then the user might be wondering why it is taking so long for their site to appear because they are getting a 503 error but 	sometimes the propagation takes up to 24 hours so they may be trying different records without 	realizing they actually wrote it correctly. You may also need to wait a long time when you change the name servers.

  <h3>A customer writes in saying their “site won’t build”.  Compose your best short (2-paragraph) customer-facing answer without any additional data, that could be useful in the generic case but would also lead to a customer providing a more actionable response.</h3>

  <p>Hi! Thanks for writing in. What exact steps did you take to try to get your site up and running? Were you using one of your own static sites or
  did you a take site from StaticGen?</p>

  <p>A common issue that comes up if you are trying to build a static NodeJS site is that package.json
    may be incorrect by not having the name of the tool you are using. For instance if you are using NodeJS then you
    would write the following in your terminal</p>

    npm install NodeJS --save

    <p>Be aware if the project directory has the same as your tool, the above command will not work. You can find more information
